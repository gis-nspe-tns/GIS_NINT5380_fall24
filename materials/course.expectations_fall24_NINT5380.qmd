## Attendance

As this course is highly dependent on sequential learning; that is, relying on learned skills to adopt new ones, maintaining good attendance in this course is critical. Certainly the unexpected happens, but if students display a pattern of attendance issues, it can become a significant problem. Further, it is critical to be on time to class.  For this Fall semester, this entails making sure that you are present for the weekly synchronous Monday meeting .  A significant portion of the participation grade involves consistent attendance and being ready for the group meeting each week.  Attendance will be taken for the Monday meeting; attendance records will then be kept on a weekly basis both within CANVAS and at Starfish.

## Course Communication

Throughout the course, students are expected to utilize course material covered during each lecture and lab to accomplish weekly technical assignments. It is often the case that each and every technical detail is NOT addressed in either lecture or lab sessions. This requires that students maintain a degree of self sufficiency in problem solving and communication to seek answers to technical blocks.  The course [Slack Team - GISNINT5380-Fall 2024 ](https://gisnint5380-fall2024.slack.com/) will have several channels appropriate to getting help from fellow students and the course instructor.

A portion of the participation grade is devoted to good communication and problem solving strategies.  Typically, each week students will receive a grade and short feedback for the technical assignment of the previous week so that students are able to build on their achievements and address any technical areas for improvement to be successful throughout the course.

Asking well-formed technical questions is a core proficiency for any technical skillset, certainly for GIS.  Review the following guide on best practices for seeking solutions to technical problems that will inevitably be part of the learning process in this course:

## Data Transfer & Storage

It is highly recommended that students utilize cloud storage for backup of each assignment as well as final project. Leaving projects and data on a computer drive without backup is not ideal. Backup your data often and in multiple locations. A USB drive will take care of basic workflow backup; but it should not be the primary - or only - backup device for your work in this class.  Make sure to zip compress your work before transport to a portable drive and/or cloud storage.  Cloud storage options include Google Drive, Dropbox, Box, ect.

## Core Computer Skills

GIS is an expansive technical field. At its most advanced, it requires many adjacent technical skills, all of which can be initiated in this class. However, a prerequisite skill set is necessary to do well in this class. This includes the following: 


- Beginning to intermediate database/spreadsheet skills (Excel, Google Sheets)
- Saving and exporting files as PDF; screengrab captures. 
- Compressing and extracting files in zip format.
- Essential navigation and use proficiency with the Windows PC Platform and/or the macOS Platform within which QGIS Desktop functions.

If you feel that you need to brush up on these computer skills, there are many resources online- google, youtube as well as the excellent [lynda.com](https://www.lynda.com/) tutorials that are freely available to TNS students. It is your responsibility to understand how to employ these skills early in the class. 

Further, all students are required  to be signed up to the course [Slack Team - GISNINT5380-Fall 2024](https://gisnint5380-fall2024.slack.com/) prior to the first class meeting - Monday, 08/26/24.

## Note
Slack Invitation Links go stale pretty quickly; join as soon as you can.  If the link above expires, let instructor Metts know via [Email](mailto:mettss@newschool.edu).

## Course Software

This course utilizes the QGIS Desktop platform to accomplish GIS tasks.  In addition to the main software component of the course - [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) - there will be several utilities that are largely cross-platform that will require online access and a browser to either access or download.

## Course Management

We will be utilizing CANVAS as the course management platform for the course.  Course instruction, assignments, lectures and labs are linked to CANVAS pages for each class session; note that here is not much actual content that resides within the course CANVAS module.  You will use CANVAS primarily to access instructional materials and necessary data; as assignments are completed, upload your final work to the assignment submission section for each class session within CANVAS. Further, students are required to keep abreast of ongoing postings on the [Slack Team - GISNINT5380-Fall 2024](https://gisnint5380-fall2024.slack.com/) and contribute their own technical questions as well as solutions, links, tips, insights. Throughout the course, the instructor will cross-post important announcements both as announcements within CANVAS, and announcements within Slack.

## Attendance

As this course is highly dependent on sequential learning; that is, relying on learned skills to adopt new ones, maintaining good attendance in this course is critical. Certainly the unexpected happens, but if students display a pattern of attendance issues, it can become a significant problem. Further, it is critical to be on time to class.  For this Spring semester, this entails making sure that you are present for both the weekly lecture and lab sessions.  A significant portion of the participation grade involves consistent attendance and being ready each week's meeting.  Attendance will be taken for both the lab and lecture; attendance records will then be kept on a weekly basis both within CANVAS and at Starfish.

## Maintaining Account Logins

Throughout this course we will be utilizing a Google account, as well as gaining many free site accounts through various geospatial data and technology platforms. These accounts often require logins, passwords and some email communication. It is your responsibility to keep these accounts organized in some fashion so you can readily access them both in and outside of class.

## Weekly Assignment Policy

Weekly assignments are due prior to the next Monday class, uploaded by Sunday night at midnight (11:59pm).

- If an assignment is late, 5-10 points are deducted from total score during the first week.
- If an assignment is late following the first week up to three weeks, half credit will be given for a completed assignment. After **three weeks**, no credit will be given for a late assignment submission.


::: {.callout-tip}
## Tip
The course will remain open within CANVAS until the end of December, 2024.  It is recommended that students build a PDF archive of weekly materials for future reference. Alternatively, the course repository at Github will be available indefinitely going forward after the conclusion of the course.

## Credit Course Load

Generally for an graduate level course of 3 credits, it is assumed that students will have a ‘homework’ load of 1-3 hours per credit. This works out to 3-9 hours per week outside of the approximately 2 hours we meet each week during the lecture and lab sessions. Although most weeks will not require this level of attention, there will be 'harder' weeks, and working in a bit more space in your weekly schedule for these weeks will help you master the theory and technical components of the week's work. Generally, make sure that you schedule ample space into your Spring 2023 schedule to allow for optimum learning and mastery. It is challenging to learn effectively if you are over-scheduled and unprepared. As a rule of thumb, you should plan for the approximately 2 contact hours for the lecture, and then allow for at least a half-day of relatively uninterrupted attention to complete the weekly assignment.  Alternatively, pick 2-3 days following the lecture and allow for separate 1-2 hour sessions for the assignment completion.
